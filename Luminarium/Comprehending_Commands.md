# cat: not the pet but the command!
The `cat` command is one of the most used command in Linux. It is often used in reading files. `cat` can also concatenate multiple files if we provide multiple arguments.
For example, `cat testbackup.txt example.txt` merges the contents of the files testbackup.txt and example.txt .
If we give no arguments at all, `cat` will read from the terminal input and output it.
In this level course we had to read the fie located in our home directory.After navigating to home using the command `cd /`, the command used was `cat flag`to obtain the flag, where 'flag' was the name of the file containing the flag.

# catting absolute paths
In the arguments of the `cat` command we can specify the absolute paths as the arguments. In this level we need to specify the absolute path as the argument for the `cat` command and obtain the flag.
We use the command `cat /flag` to read the flag file in our home directory `/`.

# more catting practice 
In this level we must use different paths to read the flag file without changing the directory. By using the `cd /` command a message shows up that tells us the absolute path of the flag file. Then we use the command `cat /opt/aflplusplus/benchmark/flag` to obtain the flag.

# grepping for a needle in haystack
One of the most important commands in the Linux system is the `grep` command. We use this command to search for the contents we need in the file.
We can us e the grep command as `grep SEARCH /path/direc/fl.txt`, where SEARCH is the content to be searched in the file fl.txt and /path/direc/fl.txt is the path to the file.
In this level we need to use `grep` to find the flag in a text file. The command used is `grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt`, where the text file `data.txt` is the file to be searched and `/challenge/data.txt` is the path to it.

# listing files 
The `ls` command will list files in all the directories provided to it as arguments, and in the current directory if no arguments are provided.
In this level the `run` file has been renamed to `7308-renamed-run-20471`. Hence we need to change the directory to `cd challenges` and the use `ls` command to get the renamed file. Then we use the command `/challenge/7308-renamed-run-20471` to obtain the flag.

# touching files
We can use the command `touch` to create new files in our directory.
In this level we need to create two files, namely 'pwn' and 'college' and then obtain the flag by running `/challenge/run`. We create the new file in 'tmp' directory by using the command `touch pwn` and `touch college` after we navigate to 'tmp' using `cd /tmp`.

# removing file
In a practical scenario we need to remove the unwanted files or the files that are needed no longer. In such cases `rm` command is helpful. The `rm` command is used to remove files.  
In this level  we need to remove the `delete_me` file from our home directory. At first we run the `ls` command to check if the file is there in the directory. Once confirmed, we use the `rm delete_me` command to remove the file. We check if the file has been deleted or not by using the `ls` command again. To obtain the flag we run the `/challenge/check`. 

# hidden files
The `ls` command when used does not list all the directories and files. The files/directories that start with a `.` is categorized as hidden and they are not listed out when we use the `ls` command. To overcome this we use the `ls -la` command, which means list-all files and directories including the hidden ones.  
In this level we need to find the flag by accessing a hidden file in the directory `/`. We navigate `cd /` and then list out all the files using `ls -la` command. A hidden file `.flag-80982409812209` is found. The we use the `cat flag-80982409812209` command to obtain the flag.

# An Epic Filesystem Quest
In this level we have to use all the knowledge about the `ls`,`cd`,`cat` commands and the `path navigation` to find clues and obtain the flag. Patience and reading the clues carefully is important in this level to move ahead. 

# making directories
Linux also provides the provision to make directories using the command line.To make a directory we use the `mkdir` command. eg: `mkdir new_dir`.  
In this level we make a directory inside the `tmp` directory. We use the command `mkdir pwn` after we navigate `cd /tmp`. We can check if the directory is made using the `ls` command. Then we navigate `cd pwn` and make a file, college, using the command `touch college`. To obtain the flag we run `/challenge/run` to indicate that we have followed the steps.

# finding files
The `find` command in Linux is used to search for files and directories within a directory hierarchy. It has a wide range of options to filter the search results based on different criteria like name, size, type, permissions, etc. If we don't specify a search criteria, `find` matches every file. eg: `find -name my_subfile`,finds the my_subfile file.  
In this level we have to use the `find -name flag` command to search for files and directories named flag. Then we need to navigate into different directories to obtain the flag. 

# linking files
In Linux, "links" typically refer to symbolic links (symlinks) and hard links. These allow files and directories to reference other files or directories without duplicating data.
1. A symbolic link is a file that points to another file or directory. It's like a shortcut in Windows. If the original file is deleted, the symbolic link becomes broken.
2. A hard link is a direct reference to the same inode as the original file. Unlike symlinks, hard links are tied directly to the fileâ€™s data, so even if the original file is deleted, the hard link still holds the data.

  
In this level, we will learn about symbolic links. Symbolic links are created with the `ln` command with the `-s` argument. `ln -s /path/to/original /path/to/link` is how we create a symlink.  
A symlink can be identified as such with a few methods. For example, the `file` command, will recognize symlinks.  
In this level we need to first create a symlink of the `/flag` by using the command `ln -s /flag /home/hacker/not-the-flag`. After this a symlink to the `flag` file is created. Then we run `/challenge/catflag` which reads out the contents from the `/home/hacker/not-the-flag` file.
